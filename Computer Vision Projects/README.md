# 🎭 Face Detection System

A real-time face detection application built with Python and OpenCV. Uses Haar Cascade classifiers to detect and highlight faces through a live webcam feed.

## 📸 Features

- **Real-time face detection** via webcam using Haar Cascade classifiers
- **Live face counter** displayed directly on the video feed
- **Snapshot capture** — save the current frame with a single keypress
- **Lightweight & fast** — no deep learning dependencies required

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection.git
   cd face-detection
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `S` | Save current frame as `captured_face.jpg` |
| `Q` | Quit the application |

## 🧠 How It Works

The application uses OpenCV's pre-trained **Haar Cascade classifier** (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) — a machine learning-based approach that identifies faces by analyzing patterns of light and dark regions across an image.

**Detection Pipeline:**
1. Capture a frame from the webcam
2. Convert the frame to grayscale (improves detection speed and accuracy)
3. Run the Haar Cascade detector with a scale factor of `1.3` and a minimum neighbor threshold of `5`
4. Draw a green bounding box around each detected face
5. Overlay the total face count on the video feed

## 🔧 Configuration

You can tune detection sensitivity by adjusting these parameters in `face_detection.py`:

| Parameter | Current Value | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `scaleFactor` | `1.3` | How much the image is scaled down at each step. Lower = more accurate, slower. |
| `minNeighbors` | `5` | Higher values reduce false positives but may miss some faces. |

## 📝 Notes

- This project uses `cv2.CAP_AVFOUNDATION` as the camera backend, optimized for **macOS**. On Linux or Windows, you can remove this flag:
  ```python
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
  ```
- Haar Cascade detection works best under **good lighting** and with **front-facing** subjects.
